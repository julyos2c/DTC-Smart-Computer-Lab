"""
CompuLab Agent — Windows lockdown helpers
==========================================

Two independent pieces of hardening, both toggled on when the lock screen
is shown and off again when it's unlocked:

  1. A low-level keyboard hook that swallows the Windows key, Alt+Tab,
     Alt+Esc, and Ctrl+Esc, so a locked PC can't be escaped via a hotkey
     into the Start menu or the task switcher.
  2. A registry policy (HKEY_CURRENT_USER ...\\Policies\\System\\DisableTaskMgr)
     that makes Windows itself refuse to open Task Manager.

IMPORTANT — read this before relying on it:
  - Ctrl+Alt+Delete CANNOT be intercepted by any user-mode script. It's a
    "Secure Attention Sequence" handled directly by Winlogon by design,
    specifically so that no application (malicious or otherwise) can trap
    it. This is not a limitation of this code — it's true of every kiosk
    tool that doesn't ship a custom Winlogon credential provider or use
    Group Policy / MDM at the OS level.
  - What DOES work here: even if a student presses Ctrl+Alt+Delete and
    picks "Task Manager" from that screen, the DisableTaskMgr policy below
    stops it from actually opening.
  - This module only writes to HKEY_CURRENT_USER, so it does not need
    Administrator rights — but it also only affects the currently logged
    in Windows user account. If your lab PCs auto-login to a single shared
    "student" account (typical for kiosk setups), this is exactly the
    right scope. For a stronger, machine-wide lockdown you'd additionally
    want Group Policy / MDM configuration, which is outside what a Python
    script can or should silently change.

Uses only the Python standard library (ctypes + winreg, both included with
the standard Windows Python installer). Safe to import on non-Windows —
every function becomes a no-op so the rest of the agent stays testable.
