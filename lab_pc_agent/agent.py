"""
CompuLab Lab PC Agent (with built-in lock screen)
===================================================

Runs on EVERY lab PC (not on the server). Two jobs in one small program:

  1. Shows a fullscreen "PC Locked" overlay the moment it starts, blocking
     the desktop underneath — no separate kiosk software needed.
  2. Listens on a local port for signed requests from the CompuLab server.
     When a student is verified, the server sends "/unlock" and this agent
     hides the overlay. The server can also send "/lock" to re-lock the PC
     remotely (e.g. when a reservation/session ends).

Honesty check, please read: this is an APPLICATION-level lock (a window
sitting on top of everything), not real OS-level security. Someone who
knows to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and open Task Manager can still end the
`python.exe`/`agent.exe` process and get to the desktop. This is the same
limitation basic kiosk lock tools have out of the box — if you need it to
be harder to bypass, that requires additional Windows admin/group-policy
lockdown (disabling Task Manager, restricting Ctrl+Alt+Del options, running
as a locked-down standard user account, etc.), which is a separate,
site-specific hardening step beyond what a script alone can do.

Requires only the Python standard library (tkinter ships with the normal
Windows Python installer) — nothing to `pip install`, EXCEPT for one
optional feature: reading the browser's address bar (so the PC Activity
Log can identify sites like ChatGPT/Claude that never put their own name
in the window title). That needs:
     pip install uiautomation
If you skip this, the agent still runs fine — window-title tracking keeps
working exactly as before, just without the extra URL-based accuracy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SETUP ON EACH LAB PC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Copy this whole `lab_pc_agent` folder to the PC (e.g. C:\\CompuLabAgent).
2. (Optional, for accurate site detection in the PC Activity Log)
   Run:  pip install uiautomation
3. Edit `agent_config.json`:
     - "secret"  -> must be EXACTLY the same string as PC_AGENT_SHARED_SECRET
                    in the server's settings.py
     - "port"    -> must match PC_AGENT_PORT in settings.py (default 5555)
     - "lock_title" / "lock_subtitle" -> the text shown on the lock screen
4. Test manually first:  python agent.py
   A fullscreen "PC Locked" screen should appear immediately.
5. Once it works, set it to run automatically at every startup — see
   "RUNNING AS A STARTUP SERVICE" below.
6. Allow inbound connections on the chosen port (default 5555) for
   python.exe through Windows Firewall, at least on the lab's network.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING AS A STARTUP SERVICE (pick one)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easiest — Task Scheduler:
  1. Task Scheduler -> Create Task
  2. Triggers tab -> New -> "At startup" (or "At log on")
  3. Actions tab -> New -> Program: pythonw.exe   (pythonw = no console window)
     Arguments: C:\\CompuLabAgent\\agent.py
  4. General tab -> check "Run whether user is logged on or not"

More robust — NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager, nssm.cc):
  nssm install CompuLabAgent "C:\\Path\\To\\pythonw.exe" "C:\\CompuLabAgent\\agent.py"
  nssm start CompuLabAgent
