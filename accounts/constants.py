"""
Central registry of Departments and the year levels each one offers.

Programs aren't all the same length (a 2-year certificate program only has
Year 1/2, a 5-year Engineering program goes up to Year 5), so year level
choices are defined *per department* here instead of as one fixed list —
this is what lets the User form / Import Students flow only offer the year
levels that are actually valid for the department picked.

To add/rename a department or change its year levels, edit DEPARTMENTS
below — everything else (choices, forms, JS for the import/user forms)
reads from this single source of truth.
